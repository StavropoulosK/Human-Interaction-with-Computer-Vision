## Human interaction with computer vision

This is a project for the course "Human-Computer Interaction".

### Summary

This project is the implementation of the game rock-paper-scissors with computer vision. The user makes a gesture on his camera, the gesture is recognised by the program and the computer choses a move arbitrarily. The user then sees the move the computer chose and whether he wins or not. It is an implementation of this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2EahPgl0ho
